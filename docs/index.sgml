<sect>Introduction
<p>

KMix is KDE's soundcard mixer program. It is thought as a convinient tool.
Though small, it is full-featured. There are regulators for each device:
One for mono devices,
and as to your liking one or two for stereo devices. Single devices may
be muted and the record source can be set.

Much fun with KDE's multimedia application wishes

<sect>Working with kmix
<p>

KMix usage is straightforward. Every mixer device that your soundcard
provides, is represented by a volume slider. Mono devices have only
one slider, Stereo devices have two sliders. You are able to merge
the two sliders of a stereo device to a single slider.
Additionaly there is a panning slider at the bottom of the KMix window.


<p>

<sect1>Volume sliders
<p>

The volume sliders show the volume of the selected device. Top is
maximum, bottom is minimum volume. The slider can have three background
colors:
<itemize>
<item><tt/Normal/ No special situation applies to this device.
<item><tt/Black/ The device is muted.
<item><tt/Red/ The device is the current record source. The device
may be muted as well.
</itemize>

The volume sliders have a context menu. Three entries are possible,
but only the applicable are shown.

<itemize>
<item><tt/Mute [On,Off]/ Mute and unmute the the device.
<item><tt/(Un-)Split/ Show either one or two sliders. Only applicable to
stereo devices.
<item><tt/Record Source/ Set this device as record source. Only applicable to
recordable devices.
</itemize>


<sect1>Panning slider
<p>

With this slider you can control the volume distribution between left
and right speaker. This slider is an overall regulator, which
affects all stereo devices (Mono devices are ignored).
The middle position is the default. Dragging the slider to the left
lowers the volume of the right speaker, dragging it to the right
vice versa. The panning slider has a context menu which you can
reach with the right mouse button. You can set the slider to some
prominent positions with this menu.


<sect1>Configuration options
<p>

The following options are automatically saved when you quit kmix
or end your session.<p>

<itemize>
<item><tt/Menu/ If switched off, the menu bar will disappear. You can
get the menu bar by pressing <tt/Control-M/.
<item><tt/Tickmarks/ Switches the Tickamrks on and off
<item><tt/Docking on the KDE Panel/ If switched on, kmix will dock
itself on the KDE Panel, when pressing the close button. If switched
off, kmix will quit, when you press the close button.
</itemize>


<sect1>Mixer layout and stored Profiles
<p>

This is one of the advanced features of kmix. If you have a standard
layout you like, you can save this layout by pressing <tt/Control-1/.
This will save the layout as profile <tt/1/. Likewise you can
save profile <tt/2/, <tt/3/ and <tt/4/. You can
restore a profile by pressing <tt/1/, <tt/2/, <tt/3/ and <tt/4/
respectively.



<sect1>Multiple Soundcards
<p>

KMix is prepared for multiple sound cards. If called via the KDE Panel,
the default mixer is used. For the Open Sound System, this is
<tt>/dev/mixer</tt>. For other operating systems or sound drivers,
this may vary.

If you want KMix to use a specific soundcard (primary, secondary, ...),
you must tell this KMix on startup. 
You can start the mixer with a device number. 0 means the default
device, 1 your primary mixer, 2 your secondary mixer and so on. If
you use this regulary, you should create a new program kdelnk (using kfm
or the menu editor). This should just call kmix with the appropriate
device number as parameter, for example "kmix 2".






<p>
<sect1> Key Bindings
<p>

KMix honors the following key bindings.

<item><tt/Down Arrow/ Decrease volume by 1% 
<item><tt/Page Up/ Increase volume by 10% 
<item><tt/Page Down/ Decrease volume by 10%

<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain KMix
<p>
KMix is a core application of the KDE project <url
url="http://www.kde.org">.
KMix can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp
site
of the KDE project.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KMix, you need the latest versions of <tt>
libkdecore</tt>
and <tt> libkdeui</tt>. All required libraries as well as KMix itself can be
found
on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">.



<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install KMix on your system, type the following in
the base
directory of the KMix distribution:
<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>


Since KMix uses <tt>autoconf</tt> you should have not trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the <sf/KDE/ mailing
lists.



<sect>Questions and answers
<p>
<itemize>
<item><tt/Q:/ I have switched the menu bar off. Do I have to hack the
config file to get it back?<p>
<tt/A:/ No, just press <tt/Control-M/

<item><tt/Q:/ When I leave kmix, and restart it, the mixer does
not restore the "split" settings of the channels.<p>
<tt/A:/ This is intended. kmix determinates on startup, whether a "split" is
  neccesary, automatically. It splits the sliders, if both channels have
  different volume settings.


<item><tt/Q:/ The program does not save any options.<p>
<tt/A:/ The "Menu", "Tickmarks" and "Docking" option are saved
automatically. The layout is saved manually in profiles.
</itemize>
