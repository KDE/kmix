<P>Thats it for today. Please mail <B>every</B> compilation problem and/or
bug to <A HREF="mailto:esken@kde.org">Christian Esken</A>,
the author of kmix.</P>
<P>Sun and SGI mixer support is included, but should be
regarded as PRE-alpha, so it is very likely not even compiling. Patches
to get it running are very appreciated.</P>
