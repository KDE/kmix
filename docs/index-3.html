<P>
<P>KMix usage is straightforward. Every mixer device that your soundcard
provides, is represented by a volume slider. Mono devices have only
one slider, Stereo devices have two sliders. You are able to merge
the two sliders of a stereo device to a single slider.
Additionaly there is a panning slider at the bottom of the KMix window.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Volume sliders</A>
</H2>

<P>The volume sliders show the volume of the selected device. Top is
maximum, bottom is minimum volume. The slider can have three background
colors:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Normal</CODE> No special situation applies to this device.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Black</CODE> The device is muted.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Red</CODE> The device is the current record source. The device
may be muted as well.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The volume sliders have a context menu. Three entries are possible,
but only the applicable are shown.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><CODE>Mute [On,Off]</CODE> Mute and unmute the the device.</LI>
<LI><CODE>(Un-)Split</CODE> Show either one or two sliders. Only applicable to
stereo devices.</LI>
<LI><CODE>Record Source</CODE> Set this device as record source. Only applicable to
recordable devices.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Panning slider</A>
</H2>

<P>With this slider you can control the volume distribution between left
and right speaker. This slider is an overall regulator, which
affects all stereo devices (Mono devices are ignored).
The middle position is the default. Dragging the slider to the left
lowers the volume of the right speaker, dragging it to the right
vice versa. The panning slider has a context menu which you can
reach with the right mouse button. You can set the slider to some
prominent positions with this menu.

<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Multiple Soundcards</A>
</H2>

<P>KMix is prepared for multiple sound cards. If called via the KDE Panel,
the default mixer is used. For the Open Sound System, this is
<CODE>/dev/mixer</CODE>. For other operating systems or sound drivers,
this may vary.
<P>If you want KMix to use a specific soundcard (primary, secondary, ...),
you must tell this KMix on startup. 
You can start the mixer with a device number. 0 means the default
device, 1 your primary card, 2 your secondary and so on.
