I believe Mixer_IRIX is broken.
This is due to the old "writeVolumeToHW" and "readVolumeFromHW" interface.

- Figure out devices like SBLive with external Live Drives and their multiple in/outs. As a sample, using headphone output from live drive, mute switch not work as they must, but we need mutting the headphone lfe and center channel to really mute headphone output.

- Introduce a new widget to enable route control in pro's ( Turtle ) and pro like ( Audigy, Live ) cards.
