TODO list

KDE4.3
1) Add feature list to KDE site

2) Add Icon and text to the OSD (optional/config?)

3) Show OSD for every global key assignment (optional/config?)

4) Warn about standard shortcuts (XF86AudioVolume*) assigned to something else (another App, or another Control in KMix).


KDE4
1) Remove ComboBox and replace it by a TabBar "corner widget" (Postponed: Not for KDE4.0)
(like the konsole session menu)

2) Replace "confusing green LED" (DONE)

3) Replace "confusing red LED" (DONE)

4) Change "id" of capture controls in mixer_alsa9.cpp. (DONE)
Rationale: We need this, so that no control id conflicts arise.
e.g. if there is a "PCM play" and a "PCM capture", everything will work strange.
Especially saving and restoring will fail. But there can also be a lot of runtime issues,
at ANY place that uses mixer ID's (and there are a lot!)

5) Move balance slider out of bottom and make it a virtual control.
Status: Pending

6) Change everything in the source code to a consistent terminology:
   The piece of hardware is now called:                  Card
   The devices/slider/controllable-thingy is now called: Control
Status: pending

7) Several bug reports, including the Audigy stuff. (DONE)

8) Resolve show issue after starting KMix (DONE)

9) Get Global Keyboard Shurtcuts work again (Check below pending)
        Check, whether ALL controls now have a global shortcut
        entry in the global KDE shortcuts "kcm" module :
        ... they should NOT, but instead only those who have actually been assigned one)

10) Layout: KMix can be made so small that Labels are partially hidden (DONE)

11) Layout: MDWSwitch layout has to be redone (Pending)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug2 in KMix2.1pre:
- Keys not saved/restored (DONE)
- DockApplet shows "show/hide menubar" (DONE)

Switches    : Read: OK, Click: OK    , Saved/Restored: yes
Dockarea    : Read: OK, Click: OK    , Saved/Restored: n/a (its a view, not HW)

2a) Splitted sliders and balance
OK
Splitted sliders: Read: OK, Click: OK, Drag: OK, Wheel: OK
Balance slider  : OK (works like in KMix2.0)

3) Mouse wheel
OK

4) Make Volume Tip work (is currently always "0%")

OK

- Figure out devices like SBLive with external Live Drives and their multiple in/outs. As a sample, using headphone output from live drive, mute switch not work as they must, but we need mutting the headphone lfe and center channel to really mute headphone output.

- Introduce a new widget to enable route control in pro's ( Turtle ) and pro like ( Audigy, Live ) cards.
