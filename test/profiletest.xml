<!-- Example from above:
     Driver   : ALSA, Versions 1.2.5 and newer.
     name  =   Card name, e.g. Hercules 7.1 (driver name is "Sound Fusion CS46xx"
     type    =   Chip type. ALSA says: "Cirrus Logic CS4294 rev 5,Cirrus Logic CS4294 rev 5,Cirrus Logic CS4294 rev 5"
     generation  = The "version" of this XML file. If you create an updated versions of this XML file, "generation" must be incremented.

<!-- The products below are for letting the user select the correct product name.
  It could be implemented like this:
   If a new GUIProfile gets seleect (either implictly on the first run or a Profile update, or
   explicitely by the user), prompt the user for the card name.
   Hint: The product stuff is only used in the GUI. It is NOT refeferenced otherwise in the code,
            and especially nothing of it is used as primary key.

<!--
    Control definitions:
    ********************
  'id' is the controls' primary key as defined by the KMix driver backend.
       This can either be a name or an id, complemeted by an optional index.
       (this is "control_name:index" or "control_id:index" or "control_id")
  'name' == What name to show to the user. (DEFAULT: Name as returned by the driver backend).
  'name_CC' is the i18n() name for country CC, e.g. "name_de" or "name_pt_BR"
             It is VERY questionable, whether we want i18n() in this XML file. It should probably better
	     be "outsourced" as every driver tends to have a limited (and well defined) set of
	     control names. This is also true for ALSA, but there we must ALWAYS be prepared for
	     new control names.
- 'controls' is an enumeration of the (sub)controls of this control, e.g "playvol:1" or
             "recvol:1-2,4-6" or "2:*,playswitch,recswitch" or ...
	     DEFAULT: "*,switches"     (* = recvol:* playvol:*   switches=playswitch recswitch genericswitch
- 'tab' is a definable tab name (DEFAULT: "Main")
  'visible' defines, whether the device will be show (default=true)
