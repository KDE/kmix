<!-- The products below are for letting the user select the correct product name.
  It could be implemented like this:

   explicitely by the user), prompt the user for the card name.
   Hint: The product stuff is only used in the GUI. It is NOT refeferenced otherwise in the code,
            and especially nothing of it is used as primary key.

    Control definitions:
    ********************

    *** comment from cesken, 13.8.2005 ***
    It is probably possible, that only soundcard specific changes against the default profile
    needs be put in a profile file. This approach has advantages and disadvantaged. This needs
    some discussion. !
    **************************************

  'id' is the controls' primary key as defined by the KMix driver backend.
       This can either be a name or an id, complemeted by an optional index.
       (this is "control_name:index" or "control_id:index" or "control_id")
  'name' == What name to show to the user. (DEFAULT: Name as returned by the driver backend).
  'name_CC' is the i18n() name for country CC, e.g. "name_de" or "name_pt_BR"
             It is VERY questionable, whether we want i18n() in this XML file. It should probably better
	     be "outsourced" as every driver tends to have a limited (and well defined) set of
	     control names. This is also true for ALSA, but there we must ALWAYS be prepared for
	     new control names.
- 'controls' is an enumeration of the (sub)controls of this control, e.g "playvol:1" or
             "recvol:1-2,4-6" or "2:*,playswitch,recswitch" or ...
	     DEFAULT: "*,switches"     (* = recvol:* playvol:*   switches=playswitch recswitch genericswitch
- 'tab' is a definable tab name (DEFAULT: "Main")
- 'show' defines, on which GUI types the control will be shown.
             simple   = Show on the simple GUI (typically only 1 Tab: Master, PCM, CDROM, Microphone)
             extended = Show on the mildly more complex GUI (all "simple" controls plus Recording & Surround stuff).
             full     = Show (only) on the full GUI (all controls)
             default is "full"
- HINT: I will probably merge "tab" and "show", like this:
     show="guitype:tabname" or show="guitype1:tabname1,guitype2:tabname2"
     For example:
     show="*:Play"
     or
     show="simple:Play,extended:Various,full:Play"
-->
<control id="Master:0" controls="*" tab="Play" name="Lautstärke" show="simple" />
<control id="Master:1" controls="*" tab="Play" name="Lautstärke 2" show="extended" />
<control id="PCM:0"    controls="*" tab="Play" name="Welle" show="simple" />
<control id="PCM:1"    controls="*" tab="Play" name="Welle 2" show="extended" />
<control id="CD:0"     controls="*" tab="Play" show="simple" />
<control id="Headphone:0"     controls="*" tab="Play" show="simple" />

<control id="CD:1"     controls="*" tab="Play" show="extended" />



<!-- Define the type of the used tabs: We need this, for knowing how the controls should be layouted -->
<!--
<tab name="Record" type="Sliders"/>
<tab name="Play" type="Sliders"/>
<tab name="Switches" type="Switches"/>
<tab name="Cool-Layout" type="Themed"/>
