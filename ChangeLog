        * ALSA support added.
          Known limitations:
	    - If another program changes a mixer setting it will not
	      automagicaly update. yet.
            - I'm unsure if they channel icons will be correct for cards
              other than my SB16. If you have a different card tell me
              if the icons match the tooltips.

	* Can now start docked.

	* Set support is basically in. No user visible aspects, though.
	* User can now switch visualization of channels on and off.
	* Options saving now works via Quit as well as via SM.
	* This revision is a major step towards kmix1.0, so I warped
	the version number to 0.80

	* Implementing major aspects of set support. Nothing
	is visible for the user at the point.

	  (0=default mixer, 1=first mixer, ...)

Thu Apr  2 20:00:00 CEST 1998
	* Added GPL headers to all *.cpp files
